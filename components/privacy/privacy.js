                  We use Google Analytics to collect information about your use
                  of our website. Google Analytics collects information such as
                  how often users visit the site, what pages they visit when
                  they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to
                  our website. We use the information we get from Google
                  Analytics to improve our website and the user experience.
                  Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you
                  on the date you visit our website, rather than your name or
                  other identifying information. We do not combine the
                  information collected through the use of Google Analytics with
                  personally identifiable information. Google Analytics plants a
                  permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a
                  unique user the next time you visit our website. This cookie
                  cannot be used by anyone other than Google. Googleâ€™s ability
                  to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
                  about your visits to our website is restricted by the Google
                  Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
